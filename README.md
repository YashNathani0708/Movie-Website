This project is a simple Movie App that allows users to search for movies by name.

JavaScript:
Use JavaScript to handle form submissions.
Add an event listener to the form's submit event.
In the event listener function:
Check if the user entered a movie name.
If yes, use JavaScript's window.location.href property to redirect the user to "working.html" (or another page based on the search results)..
